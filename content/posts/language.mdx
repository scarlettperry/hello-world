My family immigrated from Nicaragua to the U.S. Having been educated here and being the eldest child, I was their go-to translator. My communication skills were also demanded in a different way. I grew up in a multi-generational home with my grandma, parents, myself and my younger sister, and so there were as many opinions as there were years between all of us. This experience made me interested in learning other languages. I pursued this interest in high school and college by studying French and Italian, and now I am learning how to code.

I love grammar. I care about the rules of a language and of mastering the conventions so that ultimately I can be flexible (and still grammatically correct) with how I express myself. I like understanding when to use a period, semicolon, colon or hyphen. In cases where either of these options would be correct to use, I choose the one that suits the tone for the sentence.

I’ve brought this same love for and attentiveness to syntax to learning how to code. With Ruby, for example, there are many ways to accomplish the same goal. And if that’s the case, I want to understand the differences among the options so that I can choose what works best for me, so that I can have agency in the code that I write.

Language and coding is not just about expressing myself but also about connecting with people. Through decisions on how an app can reach a wide audience, being a developer is an opportunity for providing accessibility to my users.

When it comes down to it, for me, coding is communication and coding is a means for creating tools where I can express myself and assist others with learning and communicating in a digital frame.
