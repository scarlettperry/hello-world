For me, the most challenging part of CSS is positioning layout items. There are many styles for arranging elements, a bunch of possible values for that style (ie. static, absolute, fixed, relative),and their names aren’t that descriptive of what they do.

Cue: CSS grid, a new mode for layout design introduced in 2017, which allows you to easily create complex, mult-dimenstional (**rows and columns**) web layouts.

## Implementing CSS grid begins with:

(1) designating a grid container, the parent element that is the box container for your grid items

(2) selecting what those those grid items are (ie. header, sidebar(s), navigation bar, footer, etc.)

(3) designing your grid layout (how many rows and/or columns, where certain grid items go)

## Top 3 Reasons to Use CSS Grid (& how to quickly set it up)

### **1. Few lines of code**

* display: grid in your parent element, thereby designating it as the grid container

* grid-template-areas to specify the location of grid items in your grid container

* grid-template-columns to specify the size of your grid items

* grid-gap to specify the gap between your grid items

### **2. Visually represting layout in words**

Setting up your grid areas like so:

grid-template-areas: “header header header”
 “menu content content”
 “footer footer footer”;

would give you 3 rows and 3 columns in which the **header section** spans 3 columns on the first row; the **menu section** spans 1 column on the second row; the **content section** spans 2 columns on the second row; the **footer section** spans 3 columns on the third row.

### 3. **Easy Math (to visualize)**

Fractional unit fr represents a fraction of the available space of the container. I think of a pizza — the entire pizza is the grid container and each grid element is a slice of the pizza. So thinking back to middle school math, the grid element is the numerator and the grid container is the denominator. If I assign each grid item an equal slice of the pizza, then even before I preview my code on the webpage, I know that the grid items will be equally sized.

And that’s it! CSS grid is awesome.
